				  <h3>Event horizon</h3>
				  <p>
				  In general relativity, an event horizon is a boundary in spacetime
				  beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer. In layman's
				  terms, it is defined as "the point of no return", i.e., the point at
				  which the gravitational pull becomes so great as to make escape
				  impossible. An event horizon is most commonly associated with black
				  holes. Light emitted from beyond the event horizon can never reach
				  the outside observer. Likewise, any object approaching the horizon
				  from the observer's side appears to slow down and never quite pass
				  through the horizon, with its image becoming more and more
				  redshifted as time elapses. The traveling object, however,
				  experiences no strange effects and does, in fact, pass through the
				  horizon in a finite amount of proper time.
				  </p>

				  <p>
				  More specific types of horizon include the related but distinct
				  absolute and apparent horizons found around a black hole. Still
				  other distinct notions include the Cauchy and Killing horizon; the
				  photon spheres and ergospheres of the Kerr solution; particle and
				  cosmological horizons relevant to cosmology; and isolated and
				  dynamical horizons important in current black hole research.
				  </p>


				  <h4>Event horizon of a black hole</h4>

				  <p>
				  One of the best-known examples of an event horizon derives from
				  general relativity's description of a black hole, a celestial object
				  so massive that no nearby matter or radiation can escape its
				  gravitational field. Often, this is described as the boundary within
				  which the black hole's escape velocity is greater than the speed of
				  light. However, a more accurate description is that within this
				  horizon, all lightlike paths (paths that light could take) and hence
				  all paths in the forward light cones of particles within the
				  horizon, are warped so as to fall farther into the hole. Once a
				  particle is inside the horizon, moving into the hole is as
				  inevitable as moving forward in time, and can actually be thought of
				  as equivalent to doing so, depending on the spacetime coordinate
				  system used.
				  </p>


				  <p>
				  The surface at the Schwarzschild radius acts as an event horizon in
				  a non-rotating body that fits inside this radius (although a
				  rotating black hole operates slightly differently). The
				  Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to its
				  mass. Theoretically, any amount of matter will become a black hole
				  if compressed into a space that fits within its corresponding
				  Schwarzschild radius. For the mass of the Sun this radius is
				  approximately 3 kilometers and for the Earth it is about 9
				  millimeters. In practice, however, neither the Earth nor the Sun has
				  the necessary mass and therefore the necessary gravitational force,
				  to overcome electron and neutron degeneracy pressure. The minimal
				  mass required for a star to be able to collapse beyond these
				  pressures is the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, which is
				  approximately three solar masses.
				  </p>


				  <p>
				  Black hole event horizons are widely misunderstood. Common, although
				  erroneous, is the notion that black holes “vacuum up” material in
				  their neighborhood, where in fact they are no more capable of
				  “seeking out” material to consume than any other gravitational
				  attractor. As with any mass in the universe, matter must come within
				  its gravitational scope for the possibility to exist of capture or
				  consolidation with any other mass. Equally common is the idea that
				  matter can be observed “falling into” a black hole. This is not
				  possible. Astronomers can only detect accretion disks around black
				  holes, where material moves with such speed that friction creates
				  high-energy radiation which can be detected. (Similarly, some matter
				  from these accretion disks is forced out along the axes of spin of
				  the black hole, creating visible jets when these streams interact
				  with matter such as interstellar gas or when they happen to be aimed
				  directly at earth.) Further, relativity dictates that anything
				  approaching an event horizon will, from the point of view of an
				  observer, never actually cross the horizon, but will approach ever
				  more slowly, gaining mass as it does so and, correspondingly, any
				  light it emits will be further and further redshifted.
